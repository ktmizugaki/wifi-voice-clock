ESP32 Small Alarm Clock

# summarize your project (140 characters)
Small alarm clock using ESP32 module, 0.96" OLED panel and small speaker.

# describe your project (1000 characters)
This is a small alarm clock which wakes me up every morning.
This can also tell time with button push.
Clock is synchronized with NTP protocol over WiFi.
To make this as small as I can, I omitted enclosure and made the PCBs into a box.

Power source is a 400mAh LiPo battery. Battery can be charged via USB.
To save energy, device is usually in deep sleep state and display is off.

# Details
<p>This is successive project of <a href="http://ktmizugaki.so.land.to/ele/wifi_voice_clock.htm">http://ktmizugaki.so.land.to/ele/wifi_voice_clock.htm</a> .<br>While that clock is working perfectly for two years, I broke LCD and decided to upgrade project instead of replacing broken LCD.</p>

<p>The challenge for me is using OLED. I also tried to fix some of broblems and reduced width slightly.</p>

<p><strong>featrues</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Wakeup Alarm at configured time</li>
<li>Synchronize clock with NTP protocol over WiFi</li>
<li>Say time with button push</li>
<li>Show clock with button push</li>
<li>Support LiPo battery and can charge battery</li>
<li>Deep sleep to reduce power consumption</li>
<li>Check battery to prevent complete discharge</li>
<li>Web UI for configuring clock</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>structure</strong></p>

<p>Clock consists of 7 boards.</p>

<ol>
<li>MCU boards<br>This board is center of clock, enclosed by other six boards.<br>ESP32 module, 3.3V regulator, 32768Hz crystal.</li>
<li>PSU board<br>This board is bottom panel and has power related components.<br>PH connector for battery, mini B USB connector, charger IC and charge indicator LEDs</li>
<li>IO board<br>This board is top panel with switches and a speaker.<br>Also it has resistors to measure input voltage.</li>
<li>display board<br>This board is front panel with OLED dislay.<br>I added two LEDs to just fill space.</li>
<li>two side panels<br>These boards connects PSU board and MCU board (both electrically and physically)</li>
<li>back panel<br>Just a panel, no circuit on this board but has holes so that USART and reset circuit can be connected to MCU board.</li>
</ol>

# Components
1x ESP32-SOLO-1
1x 0.96" OLED panel
1x Small Speaker

# Logs
## Fixed display board
<p>I fixed display board and satisfied with layout. I hope this will be good this time.</p>

<p>And it's about time to order a speaker...</p>
<p>While waiting for new parts arrive, I'll start conding using almost working object here.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/5985241625487926255.jpg" data-image="1625487926889" style="width: 320px; height: 226px;" width="320" height="226"></figure>
<p>My plan is, when first powered up, the clock becomes an AP and user sets SSID and password via Web UI. So first thing I need to implement is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put SSID/password of clock AP on display</li>
<li>HTTP server and HTMLs</li>
</ul>

## Make OLED work
<p>I solderd OLED FPC cable to board. Then connected it to ESP32 dev baord and nothing happend.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/139851624973004731.jpg" data-image="1624973005672"></figure>
<p>I was depressed and didn't know what to do next. All what came up is checking datasheet and checking voltage of each pin.</p>
<p>When I compared pin table of datasheet and schematic, it turns out the symbol I used is not for my OLED panel.<br>Guessing from pin names, it seems like I referenced SH1106 version when I created the symbol.</p>

<p>I was able to patch circuit and now it works. Pins marked with red needs to be connected to GND and green pins are connected to GND, I added jumper cable to connect them </p>

## 2 in 1 PCB
<p>One thing I am concerning about ordering PCB is minimum quantity is usually 5 but I only need 1 clock, and remaining 4 boards will be unused.</p>
<p>So I tried to reduce unused boards by creating 2 in 1 PCB.<br>Since this clock is rectangular box, each opposite panel has same dimensions and I combined each opposite pair of panels to single panel.<br>This theoretically reduces unused materials by roughly 60% when measured by area.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/5841021624628633454.png" data-image="1624628633894"></figure>
<p>I also made the MCU board as minimal and exposed as many pins as possible so that the board possibly be used for future projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, in the rea world, PCB manufacturer send me 8 wrong thickness boards and 8 correctly remade boards.<br>Now I have 14 unused PCBs. lol</p>

# Instructions
## Cut PCB
<p>First of all, cut PCB along white line.</p>
<figure><img class="lazy" src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/859411624190915152.jpg"></figure>
<p>Below is separeted and arranged boards</p>
<figure><img class="lazy" src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6843131624190945206.jpg"></figure>

## MCU board
<p>Solder ESP32 module, decaps and reset circuit for EN pin on top of board.</p>
<figure><img class="lazy" src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6599341624284163181.jpg"></figure>
<p>Solder 3.3V regulator, 32768Hz clock crystal, capacitors and pin socket to program ESP32 at bottom of board</p>
<figure><img class="lazy" src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/791941624284427504.jpg"></figure>
<p>I could't find SMD right angled pin socket of this size, I bent leg of socket so that it looks as if a SMD socket.</p>
<figure>bent-leg</figure>
<p>then solder pinheader at left and right side. Remaining pad to solder pin socket to connect front panel will be soldered lator.</p>
<p>Now you can check if ESP32 works.</p>

## IO board
<p>Solder registers, capacitor and transistor at bottom of board.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1466081624371578978.jpg" data-image="1624371579566"></figure>
<p>Solder switches and pull-up resisters on top of board.</p>
<p>Cut leg of sockets to slightly less than board thickness before soldering so that the leg does not scratch fingers.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7271211624371566553.jpg" data-image="1624371567166"></figure>
<p>I covered unused pads with tape so that they don't interact with speaker when I placed on.<br>Remaining pad is for the speaker I haven't decided what to use.</p>

## PSU board
<p>It would be better to solder the USB mini-B socket first. This socket is only for power and signal pis are not connected.<br>The leg of the socket is hiding under housing and I could not hand solder it well :-(</p>
<p>Then solder charger IC (MCP73831) and other registers, capacitors and LEDs.</p>
<p>Then solder PH socket for battery, and pin sockets at left and right sides<br>Note to cut leg of pin sockets just like done for IO board, but different reason - I am going to add rubber foot at bottom of the board.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9523641624451917163.jpg" data-image="1624451917939"></figure>
<p>Solder right angle pin header at bottom. This is used as power switch.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9505691624451939418.jpg" data-image="1624451940090"></figure>
<p>Adhere rubber foot with double-sided tape. This fits nicely and hides pads!</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2947461625312701510.jpg" data-image="1625312702297"></figure>

## side-panels
<p>Side panels are simple. Just place parts precisely or it might not build up well. I taped it to do so.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1957381624539698769.jpg" data-image="1624539699399"></figure>

## back panel
<p>There is no component to be soldered to back panel.<br>But I filled unused TH with solder. Also solder 4 bars.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2240841625311363242.jpg" data-image="1625311363723"></figure>

## Adding holders
<p>front/back panels are not connected strongly. So I needs to add bars to support panels are fixed.</p>
<p>Add 8 valleys to top/bottom boards along straight silk marks where bars of front/back panels to be inserted.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2495131625312842331.jpg"></figure>
<p>Below picture is when I done adding valleys to top board for back panel.</p>
